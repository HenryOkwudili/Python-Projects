# // Returns integer of the operation
print(10//3)
x = 3
#the following represents an augmented assignment operator
x+=3
print(x)
#the following represents operator precedence
#order of precedence is in the order of: parenthesis, exponential
#multiplication/division then addition and subtraction
#just like BODMAS
y = 10 + 3 * 3
